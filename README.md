# dotnet-example

This is an example dotnet project (a spike) which uses [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/index.html)
 and [Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) in order to build dotnet projects using a dotnet SDK without mono.

## Operations

Compile the code:
```
./tasks build
```

Run unit tests:
```
./tasks utest
```

Run the dotnet application:
```
./tasks run
```
